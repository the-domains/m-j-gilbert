Hello! I'm glad I've peaked your interest.

This section of my website is a labor of love dedicated to somthing I'm terrified of, self promotion.

I currently work as the VFX Editor at Iloura in Melbourne, part of Deluxe. My specialty is longform storytelling, but I love working on short, arty projects as well.

My name is Michael Gilbert (often credited M.J. Gilbert) and I'm an Editor from Australia. I've been editing since I was 15 and I have a passionate love of drama and storytelling.

More to come...
