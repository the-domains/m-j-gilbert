Hello! I'm glad I've peaked your interest.

This section of my website is a labor of love dedicated to somthing I'm terrified of, self promotion.

-

I currently work as the VFX Editor at Iloura in Melbourne, part of Deluxe. My specialty is longform storytelling, but I love working on short, arty projects as well.

-

My name is Michael Gilbert (often credited M.J. Gilbert) and I'm an Editor from Australia. I've been editing since I was 15 and I have a passionate love of drama and storytelling.

-

I graduated from the Griffith Film School in 2009 with BA of Film and Screen Media Production. During my studies I worked part-time as a wedding videographer and editor to make ends meet and continued to do so for 2 years after I graduated in 2009 supplementing my income with the odd freelance project.

-

In 2010, at the age of 21, I quit my job to edit my first micro-budget feature film; a horror film called "Come and Get Me". The film and working conditions were a little outside my comfort zone but throwing myself in the deep end proved to be a valuable learning experience. And in my mind a precedence had been set; if I could edit this, I could edit anything.

-

This film screened nationally and went on to win "best editing" at the Melbourne underground film festival's Bloodfest Fantastique.

-

At the end of 2011 I cut a 60 minute documentary about spinal muscular atrophy detailing the struggles and hardships of a mother who lost 2 children to this horrible disease. It was my first real foire into documentary editing and ultimately I found the experience heartbreaking. I was used to being attached to fictional characters; but these were real people.

-

In 2012, I edited my second feature film, "Daddy's Little Girl", which has an inexplicable cult following in Germany (the german dub of this film is much better than the english one). Daddy's Little Girl also won an number of awards internationally and performed quite well at the AFM.

-

In 2013, I started working at The Post Lounge in Brisbane as an intern/junior editor. I was part-time (20hrs); but i worked a 40 hour week to make an impression on my employers; working late nights compositing for the Mark Hartley film "Patrick"; this paid off and I was given a full time position after 8 weeks of interning.
During my time working at the post lounge I worked as an assistant editor; dailies assistant; dailies transfer; online and offline editor on a number of high-profile and low profile television commercials; corporate AVs; webisodes; feature films; epks and television series.

-

In 2014, I edited my 3rd baby-budget feature film "Charlie's Farm" staring Tara Reid (The Big Lebowski; Sharknado; American Pie) and Nathan Jones (Mad Max-Fury Road; Troy). Charlie's Farm had a national cinema release in Australia and performed quite well in America and Europe. This was the first full feature film that I worked as senior editor using avid media composer; and during this 12 week project. I honed my own technique and approach to long form story-telling based on a combination of wisdom coveted from editors I admire (from interviews etc); and my own growth and development in a working environment.

-

I then went on to complete a directors cut for a feature length action-drama "Red Billabong" staring Dan Ewing (Home and Away) and Tim Pocock (X-men Origins: Wolverine) at The Post Lounge; and an assembly edit for another horror film "Boar" with an all-star cast including John Jarratt (Wolf Creek); Roger Ward (Mad Max); Nathan Jones; Ernie Dingo and Mellissa Tkautz (All Saints; Housos).
