Hello! I'm glad I've peaked your interest.

This section of my website is a labor of love dedicated to somthing I'm terrified of, self promotion.

I currently work as the VFX Editor at Iloura in Melbourne, part of Deluxe.

My specialty is longform storytelling, but I love working on short, arty peices aswell.

More to come.
